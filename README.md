This project is using machine learning methods to create work order tickets to address banking complaints so that our client, PNC can address customer problems effeciecently. 


## Use Case

Everyone uses products that at some point that doesn't work as desired. What do you do when your product doesnt work? Toss it, buy another, or call customer service. There are two perspectives to calling customer service to address a complaint. The company side and the customer side. For a company to address a complaint, they need a work order ticket that two main components, the complaint and the department that can address the complaint. The other side of this is the consumer perspective. Calling customer service to fix the problem is incredibly fustrating. You first spend 10 minutes on hold, and then have to transfer 5 more times trying to explain the probelm. Next thing you know, its been two hours, and no one has actually created the work order ticket. 

PNC wants to make this process easier for their customers.
